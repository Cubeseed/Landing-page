Feature Priority:

Low:
Analytic reporting (aside from counting number of transactions)
Multi-format conversion (requires research and/or specialists)
Collaboration controls (vague)
Distribution Channels (won't matter until we have made a significant footprint)
Dedicated support (requres staff, is expensive)
Customization
Annotation (already supported via 3rd-party apps and downloadable PDFs)
Recommendations (requires tons of metadata and a complex AI-powered algorithm)

Mid:
Data Security and privacy (certain demographic data might be lost)
DRM
Reader interaction and feedback section
cross-device sync (important but brings challanges for scalability, in addition to having to re-implement the same feature on different platforms)
Social Sharing (not too difficult to implement)

High:
Uploading content as a publisher
Metadata (we should collect any data we can, store it in database for the time being)
User-friendly interface
DRM
Social Sharing (not too difficult to implement)
Offline reading (accessability)
Formatting/Multi-language support (translator API)
